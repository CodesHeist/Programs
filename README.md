<h1>Practice Code Repository</h1>

Overview

This repository serves as a collection of my practice code written in Java and Python. It includes rough work, coding exercises, and experiments done on my local computer to improve my programming skills. The code here is primarily for personal learning and reference.

Contents





Java: Programs and snippets written in Java, covering various concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.



Python: Scripts and exercises in Python, including topics like scripting, data manipulation, and algorithm practice.



Miscellaneous experiments and rough work from my coding practice sessions.

Purpose

This repository is a personal workspace for:





Practicing coding problems and solutions.



Experimenting with new programming concepts and techniques.



Keeping a record of my learning progress in Java and Python.

Notes





The code in this repository is for practice and may not follow strict production-level standards.



Files are organized loosely, as this is a rough workspace for learning and experimentation.



Feel free to explore, but the code is primarily for my personal reference.
